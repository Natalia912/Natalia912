Hello, everyone! I'm Natalia.
I've just started my journey to become a fornt-end developer. I'm currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and I'm absolutely loving it!
I would love to participate in projects related to my sphere of interest and meet some new like-minded people. 
If you have any suggestion, hit me up on my email: tretiakowa2212@gmail.com.
