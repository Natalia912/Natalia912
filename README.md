Hello, everyone! I'm Natalia.
I started my journey to become a fornt-end developer several months ago. I have strong knowledge of HTML, CSS and good knowledge of JavaScript and React JS, and I'm absolutely loving it!
I would love to participate in projects related to my sphere of interest and meet some new like-minded people.
